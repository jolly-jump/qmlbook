"Qt 4 has evolved since 2005 and provided a solid ground for thousands of "
"applications and even full desktop and mobile systems. The usage patterns of"
" computer users changed in the recent years. From stationary PCs towards "
"portable notebook and nowadays mobile computers. The classical desktop is "
"more and more replaced with mobile touch-based always connected screens. "
"With it the desktop UX paradigms also changes. Where as in the past Windows "
"UI has dominated the world we spend more time nowadays on other screens with"
" another UI language."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ch01/index.rst:25
msgid ""
"Qt 4 was designed to satisfy the desktop world to have a coherent set of UI "
"widgets available on all major platforms. The challenge for Qt users has "
"changed today and it lies more to provide a touch-based user interface for a"
" customer driven user interface and to enable modern user interface on all "
"major desktop and mobile systems. Qt 4.7 started to introduce the Qt Quick "
"technology which allows users to create a set of user interface components "
"from simple elements to achieve a complete new UI, driven by customer "
"demands."

"Qt 5 is a complete refreshing of the very successful Qt 4 release. With Qt "

msgstr ""

"**Outstanding Graphics**: Qt Quick 2 is based on OpenGL (ES) using a scene "

"field."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ch01/index.rst:34

"**Developer Productivity**: QML and JavaScript are the primary means for UI "
"creation. The back-end will be driven by C++. The split between JavaScript "

"**Cross-platform portability**: With the consolidated Qt Platform "
"Abstraction, it is now possible to port Qt to a wider range of platforms "

"Similar to HTML, QML is a markup language. It is composed of tags called "

" from the ground up for the creation of user interfaces, speed and easier "
"reading for developers. The user interface can be enhanced using JavaScript "
"code. Qt Quick is easily extendable with your own native functionality using"
" Qt C++. In short the declarative UI is called the front-end and the native "
"parts are called the back-end. This allows you to separate the computing "

"We start with an empty document called ``main.qml``. All QML files will have"

"To place the pin wheel at the central location we use a complex property "
"called ``anchor``. Anchoring allows you to specify geometric relations "
"between parent and sibling objects. E.g. Place me in the center of another "
"element ( ``anchors.centerIn: parent`` ). There are left, right, top, "
"bottom, centerIn, fill, verticalCenter and horizontalCenter relations on "
"both ends. Sure, they need to match.  It does not make sense to anchor my "
"left side to the top side of an element."

"Placing an image as a child element of our root element (the ``Image`` "

"Now the wheel will rotate, but it is still not fluid yet. The rotation "
"property changes immediately. What we would like that the property changes "
"by 90 degree over time. Now animations come into play. An animation defines "
"how a property change is distributed over a duration. To enable this we use "
"an animation type called property behavior. The ``Behaviour`` does specify "
"an animation for a defined property for every change applied to that "
"property. In short every time the property changes, the animation is run. "
"This is only one of several ways of declaring an animation in QML."
msgstr ""

#: ../../ch01/index.rst:185
