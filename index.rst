Welcome to the online book of Qt5 Cadaques! Why Qt5? Because Qt5 is awesome! Why cadaques? Because one of the authors had a great holiday in this rocky coast line in the north-east of spain.

#. **It's not done**. We will be releasing new chapters from time to time and updating existing chapters on the go.
#. **We love your support**. If you find any errors or have suggestions, please use our feedback system (the |issues| links). It will create a new ticket-entry in our ticket system and help us to keep track.
